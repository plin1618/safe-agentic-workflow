## AI Assistant Context for SAFe Multi-Agent Development

**Repository**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Methodology**: SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) Agentic Workflow
**Philosophy**: "Round Table" - Equal voice, mutual respect, shared responsibility

---

## Quick Start

This is a **SAFe multi-agent development project** with 11 specialized AI agents working collaboratively. You are part of a team where your input has equal weight with human contributors.

**Core Principles**:
- Search for existing patterns before creating new ones ("Search First, Reuse Always")
- Attach evidence to Linear tickets for all work
- You have "stop-the-line" authority for architectural/security concerns
- Follow SAFe methodology: Epic → Feature → Story → Enabler

**Key Resources**:
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) - All 11 agent roles, invocation patterns, capabilities
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Git workflow, commit standards, PR process
- [docs/onboarding/](docs/onboarding/) - Setup guides and daily workflows
- [docs/guides/ROUND-TABLE-PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/guides/ROUND-TABLE-PHILOSOPHY.md) - Collaboration principles
- [patterns_library/](patterns_library/) - Reusable code patterns (18+ patterns, 7 categories)

## SAFe Workflow

All work follows the SAFe hierarchy and specs-driven development:

1. BSA creates spec in `specs/{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-XXX-feature-spec.md`
2. System Architect validates architectural approach
3. Implementation agents execute with pattern discovery
4. QAS validates against acceptance criteria
5. Evidence attached to Linear ticket before POPM review

### Metacognitive Tags

Use in specs to highlight critical decisions:
- `#PATH_DECISION` - Architectural path chosen (document alternatives)
- `#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY` - Areas requiring validation
- `#EXPORT_CRITICAL` - Security/compliance requirements

### Pattern Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before implementing ANY feature:**

1. Search `patterns_library/` for existing patterns
2. Search `specs/` for similar specifications
3. Search codebase for similar implementations
4. Consult documentation: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [docs/database/](docs/database/), [docs/security/](docs/security/)
5. Propose to System Architect before implementation

## Project-Specific Implementation Notes

*Customize this section for your technology stack.*

### Authentication

**Provider**: {{AUTH_PROVIDER}}

- Environment variables: See `.env.template`
- Routes: {{AUTH_ROUTES}} / {{PROTECTED_ROUTES}}
- Patterns: `patterns_library/` + [docs/security/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/security/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Payments

**Provider**: {{PAYMENT_PROVIDER}}

- Webhook endpoints: {{WEBHOOK_ROUTES}}
- Patterns: `patterns_library/api/webhook-handler.md`
- Idempotency required for all payment operations

### Analytics

**Provider**: {{ANALYTICS_PROVIDER}}

- Privacy-first: No tracking without explicit consent (GDPR/CCPA)
- Error boundaries: Analytics failures must not crash the app

### Database

**System**: {{DATABASE_SYSTEM}} | **ORM**: {{ORM_TOOL}}

**Guidelines**:
- Always use ORM (type safety) with RLS context helpers (`withUserContext`, `withAdminContext`, `withSystemContext`)
- Always create proper migrations (never `db push` in production)
- Never use direct SQL or bypass RLS policies

**Schema Docs**: [docs/database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md](docs/database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md) (single source of truth)

**Migration Workflow**:
```bash
{{MIGRATION_CREATE_COMMAND}}     # Create migration
{{MIGRATION_TEST_COMMAND}}       # Test locally
git add {{MIGRATIONS_DIR}}/ && git commit -m "feat(db): add feature migration"
{{MIGRATION_DEPLOY_COMMAND}}     # Deploy to production
```

---

## Code Quality

**Linter**: {{LINTER_TOOL}} | **Config**: {{LINTER_CONFIG_FORMAT}}

```bash
{{LINT_COMMAND}}          # Run linter
{{LINT_FIX_COMMAND}}      # Auto-fix issues
```

Always run `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` before committing. Consult your linting configuration file for project-specific rules.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**MANDATORY**: Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before any development.

### PR Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-{number}-{description}`
2. Implement with proper commits: `type(scope): description [{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-XXX]`
3. Rebase: `git rebase origin/{{MAIN_BRANCH}}`
4. Validate: `{{CI_VALIDATE_COMMAND}}` (must pass)
5. Push: `git push --force-with-lease`
6. Create PR using `.github/pull_request_template.md`
7. Merge using "Rebase and merge" only

### Branch Protection

- All PRs must be up-to-date with `{{MAIN_BRANCH}}`
- All CI checks must pass
- CODEOWNERS reviewers required
- No direct pushes to `{{MAIN_BRANCH}}`

### Manual Merge Override

Merge authority stays with the human repo owner — that never collapses. In practice it reaches GitHub two ways:

1. **The default path**: the repo owner clicks merge in the GitHub UI (or a project-specific mechanical gate does it on their behalf per pre-agreed criteria — e.g. ticket + reviewer-approval evidence). This is what step 7 above assumes.
2. **The override path**: the repo owner gives Claude a direct, explicit instruction in a live chat session to merge a specific PR right now. This is still the human deciding — it just wasn't expressed by a click, so it needs its own audit trail to stay reconstructable from repo history alone.

That trail is `/hitl-merge <PR-number>` (`.claude/scripts/hitl-merge.sh`): it merges the PR and posts a comment recording that this was a manual override, not a gate pass. Only invoke it when the repo owner has *just*, in that session, said to merge that specific PR — never because a PR looks trivial, is docs-only, or has been open a while. If a PR should merge automatically and isn't, that's a gap in this project's mechanical gate to fix, not a reason to reach for this command on your own initiative.

If a project layers additional checks on top (ticket evidence, file-based sensitivity denylists, etc.), decide per-project whether the override applies uniformly or carves out exceptions — document that choice explicitly in this file rather than leaving it implicit.
