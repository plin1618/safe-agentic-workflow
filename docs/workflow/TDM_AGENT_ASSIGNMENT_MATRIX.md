## System Architect Review Triggers (MANDATORY)

**Critical Update (v1.1)**: Based on {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 gap discovery, System Architect review is **MANDATORY** before PR creation for the following:

### Infrastructure & Automation

- [ ] **Bash scripts >100 lines**
  - Example: Deployment scripts, automation tools, setup scripts
  - {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 Gap: 710-line `deploy-migration-prod.sh` delivered without review

- [ ] **CI/CD workflow creation or modification**
  - Example: GitHub Actions workflows, pipeline changes
  - {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 Gap: 641-line `migration-validation.yml` delivered without review

- [ ] **Infrastructure-as-code**
  - Example: Terraform, CloudFormation, Docker Compose
  - Impact: Production infrastructure changes

- [ ] **Deployment automation scripts**
  - Example: Production deployment, rollback scripts
  - Impact: Security-critical operations (SSH, Docker, credentials)

- [ ] **Container orchestration changes**
  - Example: Kubernetes manifests, Docker configurations
  - Impact: Production environment changes

### Security-Critical Code

- [ ] **Database migration automation**
  - Example: Migration deployment scripts, RLS automation
  - Impact: Data integrity, security policies

- [ ] **Authentication/authorization logic**
  - Example: Auth middleware, permission checks
  - Impact: Security boundaries

- [ ] **SSH/remote execution scripts**
  - Example: Remote deployment, server management
  - Impact: Production access, credential handling

- [ ] **Secret management code**
  - Example: Credential rotation, secret injection
  - Impact: Security posture

- [ ] **RLS policy automation**
  - Example: Automated policy generation, validation
  - Impact: Data security enforcement

### Complex TypeScript/JavaScript

- [ ] **Validation/verification scripts >200 lines**
  - Example: Pre-commit hooks, data validation
  - {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 Gap: 3 TypeScript scripts delivered without review

- [ ] **Custom build tools**
  - Example: Build scripts, code generation
  - Impact: Development workflow

- [ ] **Database query builders**
  - Example: Dynamic query construction
  - Impact: SQL injection risk, performance

- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks**
  - Example: Linting automation, validation
  - Impact: Developer workflow

### When in Doubt

**Rule of Thumb**: If deliverable includes ANY executable code that could impact production, invoke System Architect.

**Example Gap ({{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321)**:

- Created: 710-line deployment script + 641-line CI/CD workflow + 3 TypeScript scripts
- System Architect Review: ❌ NOT invoked
- Result: Unreviewed security-critical code in production path

**Lesson**: Always invoke System Architect for complex automation BEFORE PR creation

## Assignment Decision Tree

### Step 1: Identify Work Type

```
What type of work is this?
├─ Requirements/Planning → BSA
├─ Database/Schema → Data Engineer
├─ API/Backend → Backend Developer
├─ UI/Frontend → Frontend Developer
├─ Testing → QAS
├─ Security → Security Engineer
├─ CI/CD → RTE
├─ Coordination → TDM
└─ Architectural Review → System Architect
```

### Step 2: Check Complexity

```
Does work include complex code/automation?
├─ YES → Check System Architect review triggers
│   ├─ Bash script >100 lines? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ CI/CD workflow? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ Infrastructure automation? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   └─ Security-critical code? → MANDATORY System Architect review
└─ NO (documentation only) → Proceed with specialist assignment
```

### Step 3: Assign Specialist

Based on work type, assign to appropriate specialist agent.

### Step 4: System Architect Review (if triggered)

If any complexity trigger matched:

1. Specialist completes work
2. **MANDATORY**: Invoke System Architect for review
3. System Architect approves OR requires fixes
4. Only after approval: Proceed to PR

## Common Assignment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Feature Implementation (with Exit States)

```
BSA (Spec)
    │
    ▼
BE Developer → Exit: "Ready for QAS"
    │
    ▼
QAS (Gate) → Exit: "Approved for RTE"
    │
    ▼
RTE → Exit: "Ready for HITL Review"
    │
    ▼
HITL → MERGED
```

### Pattern 2: Database Migration

```
BSA (Spec) → Data Engineer (Migration) → Security Engineer (RLS) → System Architect (Review) → RTE (PR)
```

### Pattern 3: Complex Automation ({{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 Pattern)

```
Investigation → Data Engineer (Scripts) → System Architect (Review) → RTE (CI/CD) → System Architect (Final Review) → PR
```

**Note**: Pattern 3 is the CORRECT workflow. {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-321 skipped both System Architect reviews.

### Pattern 4: UI Feature

```
BSA (Spec) → FE Developer (Component) → QAS (E2E Tests) → RTE (PR)
```

### Pattern 5: Collapsed RTE Workflow ({{TICKET_PREFIX}}-499)

```
BSA (Spec)
    │
    ▼
BE Developer → Exit: "Ready for QAS"
    │
    ▼
QAS (Gate) → Exit: "Approved for RTE"
    │
    ▼
[BE handles PR creation - RTE collapsed]
    │
    ▼
HITL → MERGED

Note: QAS gate is ALWAYS present, never collapsed
```
